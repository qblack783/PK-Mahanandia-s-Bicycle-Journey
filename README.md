# PK-Mahanandia-s-Bicycle-Journey
PK Mahanandia Journey Map

I just read about PK Mahanandia’s iconic bicycle journey — and thought: what an incredible story for love.
In the 1970s, PK cycled thousands of miles from India to Sweden to reunite with his love. His story is a testament that the bare minimum doesn’t exist when it comes to true love, courage, and commitment.

This project is a simple Python visualization that maps out his route and brings his journey to life — reminding us that sometimes, love really does move mountains.

What It Does

Highlights key stops along the route.
Includes popups with photos and facts about each location.
Saves as an HTML file you can open in any browser.
How to Run

Install folium:
pip install folium
Run the Python script:

Open the generated pk_mahanandia_journey.html in your browser and explore the route!
Why It Matters
"Love recognizes no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination full of hope."
— Maya Angelou
PK Mahanandia’s story is a reminder that real love goes the distance and to find or let that person come to you is 🤌🏽 - literally.
